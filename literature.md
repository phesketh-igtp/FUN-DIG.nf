### Andreano *et al* 2023 - Rapid and real-time identification of fungi up to species level with long amplicon nanopore sequencing from clinical samples

- Tests the clinical suitability of using long-read-sequencing of samples from either of with clinical signs of infections
- Big problems with phylogenetic gaps in genetic knowledge to old species descriptions
- 

<u>**Methods:**</u>
- Primers:
    1. V3 region of 18S to D3 region of the 28S (~3,500 bp len)
    2. V1 region of 18S to D12 region of 28S  gene (~6000 bp len)
